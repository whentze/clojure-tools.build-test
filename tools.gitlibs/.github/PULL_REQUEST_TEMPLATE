Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project.

Clojure contrib projects do not use GitHub issues or pull requests.
If you would like to discuss a problem or enhancement request, please
file a question to discuss on https://ask.clojure.org and use the
appropriate category under "Contrib libs". If necessary, a JIRA will
be filed by a developer.

For more information on contributing to Clojure projects, see:
